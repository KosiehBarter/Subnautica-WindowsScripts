# Subnautica - Nitrox
## Helper scripts

These scripts are designed to automate Windows firewall rules.

These scripts (bat for Windows 7 and below, possibly, PS for Windows 8 and up) are designed
to open firewall ports for Subnautica mod called "Nitrox" and make players able to connect 
to each other by using VPN Hamachi.

Currently, only Hamachi is supported.
